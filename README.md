# slither
A movement from Python to APL

Hackr.io offers a portfolio of Python projects by Robert Johns: [40+ Python Projects + Source Code | Beginner to Advanced](https://hackr.io/blog/python-projects). 

Slither takes some of these projects and translates the solutions from Python into APL, first minimally, keeping the APL code close to to the Python, then in ‘APL-literate’ form, demonstrating a more array-oriented solution.

It offers practice examples to study for Pythonistas learning APL, also a showcase of directly equivalent Python and APL programs in which to compare the two languages.


## Contribute

Exercise caution when comparing APL and Python solutions.
Many of the originals are written as exercises for beginners and limit their use of Python language features that might yield more of the terseness APL programmers aspire to.

Feel free to contribute a more advanced Python version, but leave the originals exactly as scraped from the Web.

Also feel free to contribute further examples, either from the Hackr.io article or elsewhere.
For these, prefer programs that demonstrate APL features not otherwise represented here.

Contact the repo owner at sjt@lambentechnology.com if you wish to discuss a candidate.
